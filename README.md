# Active Directory Home Lab Deployment
**(VirtualBox + Windows Server 2025 + Windows 10)**  
**Hands-on Simulation of a Domain Environment with User Management and PowerShell Automation**

## Project Overview
This repository documents my step-by-step build of an **Active Directory home lab** in Oracle VirtualBox.  
The lab simulates a small enterprise network environment, including:
- Windows Server 2025 Domain Controller
- Windows 10 domain-joined workstation
- Dual network adapter configuration for realistic segmentation
- PowerShell automation for bulk user creation
- Networking setup mirroring real-world practices
